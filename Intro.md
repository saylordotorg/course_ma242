Real Analysis II is the sequel to Saylor’s Real Analysis I, and together
these two courses constitute the foundations of real analysis in
mathematics. In this course, you will build on key concepts presented in
Real Analysis I, particularly the study of the real number system and
real-valued functions defined on all or part (usually intervals) of the
real number line. The main objective
of [MA241](http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma241/) was to introduce you to
the concept and theory of differential and integral calculus as well as
the mathematical analysis techniques that allow us to understand and
solve various problems at the heart of science—namely, questions in the
fields of physics, economics, chemistry, biology, and engineering. In
this course, you will build on these techniques with the goal of
applying them to the solution of more complex mathematical problems. As
long as a problem can be modeled as a functional relation between two
quantities, each of which can be expressed as a set of real numbers, the
techniques used for real-valued functions of one variable should
suffice. However, most practical problems cannot be modeled via
functions of a single real variable. For instance, modeling a moving
particle in space requires three real variables in the three-dimensional
coordinate system of real numbers. In another example from physics, the
altitude a projectile will reach—a quantity described by one real
variable—depends on two factors: the weight of the projectile as well as
the initial velocity it has acquired from some external
force. Sometimes, depending on the answer desired, a problem may be
modeled as a single-variable or a multivariable function. For example, a
particle moving in three-dimensional space through a force field (think
of a dust particle floating in the air as it is blown by gusts of wind)
may be modeled either as a function of time (a single-variable function)
to describe the coordinates of the particle at each instance of time;
or, if one is interested in the final resting place of the particle as a
function of its initial position, the same problem may be modeled as a
multivariable function that requires three inputs (the coordinates of
the initial position) in order to produce three outputs (the coordinates
of the resting place). In this course, you will learn about some of the
intricacies of the geometry of higher-dimensional spaces, how the theory
of multivariable functions is developed, and how to apply the advanced
techniques of differentiation and integration to such functions.
Finally, you will explore applications of these advanced techniques to
the solution of complex mathematical problems.

### Course Information

Welcome to **MA242**. General information on this course and its
requirements can be found below.  
    
 **Course Designer:** Ittay Weiss, Ph.D.  
    
 **Primary Resources:** This course draws on a range of different free,
online educational materials, with primary use of the following online
textbooks:  

-   Professor Elias Zakon’s *[Mathematical Analysis: Volume
    II](http://www.trillia.com/zakon-analysisII.html)* (PDF)
-   Trinity University: Dr. William Trench’s *[Introduction to Real
    Analysis](http://ramanujan.math.trinity.edu/wtrench/texts/TRENCH_REAL_ANALYSIS.PDF)* (PDF)
-   Cornell University: Dr. Reyer Sjamaar’s *[Manifolds and Differential
    Forms](http://www.math.cornell.edu/~sjamaar/papers/manifold.pdf)* (PDF)

**Requirements for Completion:** In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned readings and
materials. Be sure to follow carefully the instructions for each unit
and assignment, as these guidelines are designed to lead you in an
efficient study of the material. As instructed, you also will need to
complete all the assigned problem sets within specific units and
subunits of this course. Finally, you must successfully complete and
pass the course’s Final Exam.  
    
 Please note that you will receive an official grade only on your Final
Exam. In order to pass this course, you will need to earn a 70% or
higher on the Final Exam. Your score on the exam will be tabulated as
soon as you complete it. If you do not pass the exam, you may take it
again.  
    
 **Time Commitment:** This course should take you a total of **137
hours** to complete. Each unit includes time advisories that list the
amount of time you are expected to spend on each subunit and assignment.
These time advisories should help you plan your coursework accordingly.
It may be useful for you to take a look at these time advisories and to
determine how much time you have over the next few weeks to complete
each unit, and then to set goals for yourself. For example, Unit 1
should take you approximately 66 hours to complete. Perhaps you can sit
down with your calendar and decide to complete Subunit1.1 (a total of 4
hours) on Monday and Tuesday nights; Subunit 1.2 (a total of 6 hours) on
Tuesday and Wednesday nights; etc.  
    
 **Tips/Suggestions:** The course is a continuation of Saylor’s
[MA241](http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma241/), Real Analysis I, and thus
assumes a level of mathematical maturity that would be expected upon
mastery of MA241. Please keep in mind that the indicated time advisories
for each unit, subunit, and assignment of this course are not absolute,
and heavily depend on your own personal mastery of the material in
MA241. For example, you may find yourself spending more time on certain
topics than is suggested in the time advisory for each unit; or you may
need to spend more time on reviewing the background material presented
in MA241. If this happens, just keep in mind that it is not necessarily
a problem, but rather another opportunity to improve, enhance, and hone
your previous knowledge. Please note that you do not need a calculator
for this course, but be sure to have plenty of scrap paper and a writing
utensil available to you at all times, since you will be performing
calculations, stating proofs, and working through problem sets
throughout each unit of this course and during the Final Exam.  
    
 Please note that understanding the exercises presented in the below
course materials is an absolutely essential part of internalizing the
new subject matter. Although it is not always necessary that you
complete each and every exercise for a given assignment, it is
imperative that you take the exercises supplementing each reading
seriously. To aid you in the learning process, the instructions for each
unit and assignment may indicate which exercises are more or less
crucial than others. In particular, the time advisory for each
assignment, unless stated otherwise, is not meant to indicate how long
it should take you to solve all the exercises for a particular reading,
but rather how much time you should spend on both the reading and your
attempts to solve the exercises. When certain exercises are imperative,
or when solving many exercises is required to understand fully the
material, this requirement (and additional allotted time) will be
indicated clearly in the time advisory.
